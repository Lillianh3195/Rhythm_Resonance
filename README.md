# Rhythm_Resonance
Rhythm Resonance is a pixel rhythm PC game starring four instrumental beatmaps: a triangle, guitar, piano, and violin. The player can flip the camera between two perspectives, causing musical notes to come from either the side or towards the player. Coded in C# within Unity, this project utilized LMMS (Linux MultiMedia Studio) to chart the music and a .NET library called DryWetMidi to analyze the MIDI files, thus generating notes on the correct time.
